## Overview

In this project, I developed an AI-powered real-time car counter using OpenCV. The goal was to create a solution that can accurately count cars from a live video feed, providing essential data for traffic monitoring and management. The project uses computer vision algorithms to detect vehicles and track their movement, offering real-time insights with minimal computational resources.

## Key Features

- **Vehicle Detection**: Utilized OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers to detect vehicles in real-time from a video stream.
- **Real-Time Counting**: Developed an efficient algorithm to count vehicles as they move across predefined lanes in the camera's view.
- **Tracking and Accuracy**: Integrated tracking methods to enhance counting accuracy, even with occlusions or high-speed vehicles.
- **Visualization**: Displayed real-time results with a graphical overlay that highlights detected vehicles and counts, ensuring easy monitoring.
- **Scalability**: The system can be easily adapted to various environments, making it scalable for different traffic scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: For real-time computer vision tasks including object detection and tracking.
- **Python**: For algorithm implementation and data processing.
- **TensorFlow**: Used for training and optimizing machine learning models for object detection.
- **NumPy and Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the detection results and vehicle count.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was handling occlusions (when vehicles overlap), which could result in miscounts. I experimented with multiple tracking algorithms and fine-tuned the system to minimize these errors. Another hurdle was processing video feeds in real-time, which required optimizing the algorithm for faster frame processing. Through this, I learned the importance of balancing accuracy with computational efficiency.

## Outcome

The AI-powered car counter successfully achieved real-time vehicle counting, with a 95% accuracy rate in ideal conditions. This solution can be used in traffic management systems to monitor congestion, optimize traffic light systems, or gather data for urban planning. The project demonstrates the potential of AI and computer vision to improve the efficiency of traffic management.
