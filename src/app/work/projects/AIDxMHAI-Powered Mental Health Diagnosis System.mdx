## Overview

AI-DxMH is an AI-powered mental health diagnosis system that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to assist in detecting mental health conditions. The system analyzes user responses, behavioral patterns, and linguistic cues to identify potential indicators of mental health disorders, providing early insights for intervention.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilized advanced NLP techniques to analyze textual responses for psychological markers.
- **Machine Learning-Based Classification**: Implemented supervised learning models to classify responses and detect mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, and stress.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrated sentiment analysis to assess emotional tone and psychological well-being.
- **Personalized Insights**: Provided users with personalized feedback and potential recommendations based on model predictions.
- **Scalable and Secure**: Designed to handle large-scale data while ensuring user privacy and confidentiality.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Used for data preprocessing, model development, and deployment.
- **TensorFlow & Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and training classification models.
- **NLTK & SpaCy**: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition.
- **Flask & Streamlit**: For developing an interactive web-based interface for users.
- **AWS**: Leveraged cloud-based storage and compute resources for scalability.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring the model's accuracy while maintaining ethical considerations regarding mental health predictions. Handling ambiguous responses and differentiating between varying levels of distress required fine-tuning NLP techniques. Additionally, implementing privacy-preserving mechanisms was crucial in dealing with sensitive mental health data.

## Outcome

AI-DxMH successfully demonstrated the potential of AI in assisting mental health professionals by providing early insights based on AI-driven analysis. The system achieved an **85% accuracy** in identifying mental health conditions, making it a promising tool for preliminary mental health assessment. This project underscores the importance of AI in healthcare and its potential to contribute positively to mental well-being.
